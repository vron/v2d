# v2d
2D vector math library in golang.

![Test](https://github.com/vron/v2d/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

There exist several ones, but could not find one fitting my requirements of:

 * MIT license
 * All operations on values, not pointers
 * float32
 * 2D optimized

Inspired by https://github.com/joonazan/vec2 which however does not specify any license.
